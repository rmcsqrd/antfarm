### TODO

#### Package functionality 
- Clean out all the CSCI shit
- publish FMP as a standalone package - button it up all nice with documenation and stuff
- parallelize it but do it so it can run on one core only as well
- make antfarm your thesis repo and FMP.jl is a separate one, maybe under julia dynamics? follow up on the github issue to see what those guys think.

#### Algorithm functionality


#### Thesis Ideas
