### TODO

#### Package functionality 
- figure out display scaling issues - probably change this at the agent level by rendering objects as a series of small radius/small display dots so you can get more realistic collisions

#### Algorithm functionality
- figure out how to properly implement the object avoidance term pj-rj-pi
    I think my method works now?
- fix gridlock phenomena
