### TODO

#### Package functionality 
- look at model.scheduler to schedule how things are drawn to avoid overlap?

#### Algorithm functionality
- figure out how to properly implement the object avoidance term pj-rj-pi
    I think my method works now?
- fix gridlock phenomena
- figure out /2 distance thing that is in object avoidance. Was there originally but I forgot why. Also I added in a radius thing into that and it visually looks good but idk - verify terms per original paper
- look into model.d term which dictates model.r. Is this a diameter or distance min? ref original paper. Also comment all model inputs for clarification

#### CSCI Project Ideas
- simulate gridlock conditions for number of agents, plot with respect to mean distance between agents etc

#### Thesis Ideas
